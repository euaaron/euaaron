  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there! I'm a Brazilian who always loved to create things and learn about technology - I mean every kind of tech not only IT. I like to create every kind of things, since draws, videos, sculptures, 3D models, animations, softwares, websites, create new food recipes or write fiction stories and I'm always trying to learn better ways to do those things. Recently while reading an interview with Bill Gates I discovered the word that describes me: "Generalist".
</p>

In 2020 I did [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat)'s [GoStack bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br), where I've learned a lot about React universe, Typescript, REST APIs and more... I highly recommend it to everyone.

I'm now focusing at Architecture and Design Patterns.

### Some facts about me

- I never throw my earphones or headphones away when they break, so I can fix one using the other.
- I've made a **Minecraft** mod when I was a teenager and also a showcase on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bGlQ9oIFqCk).
- I fix my computer myself since when I was a kid and just let others do after I try.
- I have some difficult to talk with others at the beginning but then I can't stop.
- I have some **terrible** karaoke records on [Smule](https://www.smule.com/relbeits).
- I love to be challenged and help others with theirs.
- I've been programming for years but only now (2022) I've became confident with my programming skills.
